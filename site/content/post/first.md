title: Faast Publishing with Netlify
---
This is my first post using the Netlify platform. A very interesting way to publish with style some information about my activities and me. Build upon the [Github](https://github.com) platform, it is one of the more convinient way to write, publish and track a simple blog, with some everyday tools I am using to create and build my own homegrown projects.

Writing posts as simple amrkdown pages, and proposing some basic but smart theming features, it is very easy to create content.

Just have fun using it and write some text.

McG.
